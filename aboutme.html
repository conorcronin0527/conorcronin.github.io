<P> I'm Conor Cronin and i am from Fairfield Connecticut. . I grew up in a huge town of 66,000 people. I have the greatest family with my parents as well as two younger sisters and our yellow lab. I am the oldest of my siblings so going away to school 6.5 hours from home made my parents nervous. I am excited to study at the business school here at Umaine!
<p> My major is Marketing and I chose it because both of my parents have business degrees as well as MBA's. I also have several other family members that work for sales or banking companies so I'd like to keep my options open. I also am an hour train ride from New York City, and a twenty minute train ride to Stamford.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> Sports has been a great passion of mine and I have been involved with athletics since I was young. I played everything from soccer, to baseball, to basketball, to football, and even lacrosse and rugby. Sports has always been a big part of my life and always will be. </center></p>

<p> I recently picked up skiing. I used to regularly ski in Vermont when I was younger but this year was the first time in about 10 years that I've hit the slopes.  </p>
