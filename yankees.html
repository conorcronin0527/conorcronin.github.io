<p style="text-align: center"> Coming from Connecticut, and being an hour train ride from New York City, I grew up a huge New York Sports fan, especially the New York Yankees. Out of their 82 game season, I try to watch everyone one of there games and always try to go to as many as possible during the spring/ summer. After seeing the Red Sox win it this past year, I'm itching to see the first New York sports championship in the last 10 years! </center></p>
